# MTForestNet
The novel multitask learning method MTForestNet that can deal with data scarcity problems and learn from tasks with distinct chemical space. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the MTForestNet, 48 zebrafish toxicity datasets were collected and utilized as an example. In an independent test, MTForestNet with a high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.911 provided superior performance over compared single-task and multitask methods. The overall toxicity derived from the developed models of zebrafish toxicity are well correlated with the experimentally determined overall toxicity. The developed models are effective for predicting zebrafish toxicity and the proposed MTForestNet is expected to be useful for tasks with distinct chemical space that can be applied in other tasks.
